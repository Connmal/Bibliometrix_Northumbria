abstract={Quantitative analysis in this special issue (Greenfield, Brown, & Du, 2021) showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has led most parents to report greater expectations for their children to help with family subsistence. This familistic development exemplifies the shifts in behavior and values predicted by Greenfield's Theory of Social Change, Cultural Evolution, and Human Development when survival concerns rise and the social world retracts. Here, we use qualitative analysis to uncover the psychological processes behind the quantitative shift. Our California sample consisted of 109 parents with at least one child between age 7 and 18 living at home during the pandemic when they answered the survey. Forty-six of these parents provided qualitative data concerning expectations for their children's household responsibilities during COVID-19. An open-ended question asked parents to explain why their expectations of their children to help around the house and to carry out self-maintenance had changed or remained the same. Prominent themes in the qualitative responses manifest a shift from a mindset found in a large-scale urban society toward that found in a small-scale subsistence community: Before the pandemic, parents focused on increasing their children's competitiveness in society through extracurricular activities like tutoring, but that transitioned into a focus on household duties such as cooking and cleaning. In some cases, this shift was linked to an increase in life satisfaction; in other cases, it was linked to a decline in life satisfaction. © 2022},

abstract={The current technologies for handling oil spill clean-up vary in expense and effectiveness and are largely ineffective. Oil spills occur due to accidents from wellheads and damaged facilities in the creeks of the Nigerian Delta and along the coastline of waters where hydrocarbons are prospected all over the world. They are unexpected and known to cause irreparable damage to aquatic environments and marine life. The development of a hydrophobic mesh is proposed to prevent oil from spreading into larger areas and from reaching sensitive coastlines. This will help engineers and cleanup crews in their quest to find an appropriate response to a given oil spill scenario as they race against the clock to prevent further damage and improve the oil recovery process. The overall goal of this project is to create a Numerical Simulation of meshes that repel water and attract oil using ANSYS, a Finite Element Analysis software. The mesh was modelled as a porous medium that acts like a filter that retains water on one side while allowing the passage of oil through it. In the course of this work, appropriate materials selection in fluid flow analysis was carried out. Also, the flow domain geometry was developed in such a way as to simulate a system containing an oil-water interface. Next, domain discretization (meshing) was carried out appropriately. After which appropriate boundary conditions and operating conditions were implanted in the model. Fluent was then set to initialize and run calculations. After calculations were run, results were gotten. These results were then interpreted pictorially. It was seen that the velocity streamlines for the oil phase passed through the hydrophobic mesh, while the velocity streamlines for the water phase were repelled from the hydrophobic mesh wall © 2022, Mathematical Modelling of Engineering Problems.All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Background: Qatar has a unique demographic composition, involving hundreds of thousands of male blue-collar workers living in places where physical distancing measures are difficult to implement. This study aimed to describe the rapid development and operations of a temporary isolation facility, which was composed of tents, for asymptomatic COVID-19 positive migrant workers. Design: The government established several temporary isolation facilities to house this important group of the community. This was achieved through daily meetings over a short period, thanks to the collaboration of government and private partners, in parallel to the facility being built and required resources procured. Results: A 3,726-patient capacity isolation facility composed of large tents was constructed in 1 month and was kept operational from April 16 to June 20, 2020. Over that period, it received a total of 18,900 patients. It took 10 days from the decision to set up the first part of the isolation facility to admitting its first occupants. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the implementation of unprecedented global public health and physical distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus among the population. Rapidly opening a temporary COVID-19 isolation facility bought the healthcare sector time to set up more permanent solutions to contain the spread of the virus. © 2022 Alinier, Al Badawi, Gharib, Ramsumar, Morris, licensee HBKU Press.},

abstract={This article examines the gender-blind perception of the social work profession in Croatia and its relation to domestic violence cases. In the past few years, the media and the public have routinely expressed outrage at social workers for not preventing severe cases of violence against women and children. The shift from state socialism to capitalism in Croatian society has considerably affected the profession of social work and facilitated the defunding and understaffing of the welfare sector. I argue that a more nuanced, gendered approach is needed in demanding prevention work from social work centres (SWC). Most studies on the causes of burnout in social workers have ignored the feminisation of the profession and the gendered implication of their precarious professional position and responsibility to protect and help the most vulnerable members of society. The perceptions of social work by other experts working with cases of domestic violence and social workers themselves are important to comprehend a bigger picture of professional judgment and attributions of blame. In-depth interviews were conducted with experts working with domestic violence, including the police, judges, prosecutors, social workers, feminist NGO coordinators, and women’s shelter workers. The feminisation of social work and systemic undervaluing of care work contribute to the easy targeting of social workers while leaving the patriarchal institutionalisation unexplored. For this reason, I conclude that social workers would benefit from class and gender solidary with their clients to fight patriarchal biases. © 2022, Croatian Sociological Association.

abstract={The production of electric vehicle battery packs with ever-increasing energy densities has accelerated the electrification of the world's automotive industry. With increased attention on the electric vehicle markets, it is vital to increase the safety of these vehicles which now hold higher hazardous potential. This paper aims to explore the field of pack-level thermal runaway mechanisms and evaluate potential mitigation strategies. Most available literature concentrates on the micromanagement of thermal runaway whereas this paper takes a more holistic approach. Thermal simulations for analysing thermal runaway of modules in differing locations are run to characterise the behaviour of a thermal runaway event at pack-level. Results suggest that the propagation of thermal runaway is consistently severe in a cooling plate cooled battery pack as the cooling plate acts as a channel for high temperatures. Additionally, thermal insulation added to contain the rapid increase in temperature unfortunately results in wider spread higher temperatures. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Digital twins is an increasingly valuable technology for realising smart cities worldwide. Visualising this technology using mixed reality creates unprecedented opportunities to easily access relevant data and information. In this paper, a digital twins-based system is designed to visualise information from a city's street lighting system. Data is obtained in two ways: from measured parameters of a miniature model street light in real-time, and from real Durham street lighting. Machine learning is used to maximise the efficiency of purchasing electricity from the grid, and to forecast appropriate adaptive street light brightness levels based on city's traffic flow and solar irradiance. An application designed in Unity Pro is deployed on a Microsoft HoloLens 2, and it allows the user to view the processed data and control the model street light. It was found that the application performed as desired, displaying information such as voltage, current, carbon emission, electricity price, battery state of charge and LED mode, while enabling control over the model street light. Moreover, the Deep Q-Network machine learning algorithm successfully scheduled to buy electricity at times of low price and low carbon intensity, while the Long Short-Term Memory algorithm accurately forecasted traffic flow with mean Root-Mean-Square Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error values of 12.0% and 20.0% respectively. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The link between sleep and cognition is well-established, but the link between subjective sleep and fluid intelligence is poorly understood. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between habitual subjective sleep continuity and fluid intelligence. In this study, a total of 56 healthy sleepers (Mage = 30.91 years; SDage = 12.93 years) completed two fluid intelligence (abstract reasoning and two-dimensional mental rotation) tasks after completing seven consecutive days of sleep diaries. Relationships between subjective sleep continuity (total sleep time [TST]; sleep efficiency [SE%]); wake after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep onset latency (SOL), and task accuracy and speed were assessed using Pearson correlations. Overall, there were no associations between subjective sleep continuity (TST, SE%, WASO, SOL) and either task accuracy or speed (adjusted p-values > 0.0125). Overall, habitual subjective sleep continuity and fluid intelligence may not be associated. These results should be replicated in larger samples © 2022 The Korean Society of Sleep Medicine},

abstract={This article takes an ecological approach to examine the legacies of austerity for local authority welfare systems in England and the implications for families seeking to use these services. Programmes of Early Intervention or Early Help that promote ‘resilience’ amongst marginalised families and reduce future dependency upon state services have been advocated consistently in the UK, currently intensifying with a period of welfare retrenchment and restructuring. Many programmes and approaches being promoted prioritise a discourse of individual or familial responsibility and seek to deflect attention away from structural and environmental changes that have taken place. We explore local authority family and child support services as relational care practices that have been fundamentally reshaped through austerity, and in doing so we seek to shift the conversation from individual responsibility to systemic and collective vulnerabilities. Drawing on the concept of ‘care ecology’ to conceptualise local authority Early Help services as ‘carescapes’, we focus specifically on the changing context of ‘Family Hubs’, and the fragmented nature of service provision. As with any ecosystem, care ecologies are constituted by interconnected and interdependent actors, processes and systems. Damage to them produces unintended consequences which exacerbate underlying ‘vulnerabilities’. We explore this as a legacy of austerity, noting that this has resulted in forms of socio-spatial distancing from care provision for families, disrupting protective networks and support systems. We argue that local authority support services would be better focused on systemic and collective vulnerabilities rather than individual responsibilities in order to provide meaningful support to families.

abstract={IMPACT: Financial, performance and workload pressures on public services are increasing. Methods which enable practitioners to pool together and reflect on ‘practical wisdom’ to make better decisions in the navigation of complexity have the potential to improve the practitioner and service user experience and enable more effective targeting of resource-intensive interventions. This article contributes to the improved understanding of the practicalities, limitations and opportunities of surfacing and sharing tacit knowledge in the public sector environment. It will be of value to healthcare and social care practitioners, commissioners, service managers, educationalists and organizational development leads. © 2023 The Author(s).

abstract={Background: It is well-recognized that early parenting significantly influences the health and well-being of children. However, many parents struggle with the daily demands of being a parent and feel overwhelmed and exhausted psychologically and physically. Encouraging self-care practices is essential for parents, and self-compassion may be a potential strategy to utilize. Objectives: The review aims to assess the influence and impact of providing self-compassion education for parents and families when caring for their children. Methods: This systematic review utilized Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. A three-stage search approach was undertaken that included seven electronic databases, registries and websites. These databases are Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Emcare, Cochrane library, Scopus, and ProQuest. The included studies were appraised using the standardized critical appraisal instruments for evidence of effectiveness developed by JBI. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies confirmed improved psychological well-being, and higher levels of self-compassion, kindness towards oneself and others, and mindfulness were reported. In addition, there were improvements in psychological well-being, decreased parental distress and perceived distress, lower levels of anxiety, and avoidance of negative experiences. Conclusion: The findings provide evidence to guide further research on developing, designing, facilitating, and evaluating self-compassion education programs and workshops for parents and families.

abstract={Cybercrime is a growing issue, still not fully understood by researchers or policing/law enforcement communities. UK Government reports assert that victims of cybercrime were unlikely to report crimes immediately due to the perception that police were ill-equipped to deal with these offences. Additionally, these reports identify policing issues including a lack of cybercrime knowledge. This paper reviews current research, providing a comprehensive account of cybercrime and addressing issues in policing such offences. We achieve this by describing the technological, individual, social and situational landscapes conducive to cybercrime, and how this knowledge may inform strategies to overcome current issues in investigations. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={The emotional assessment under internet of things (IoT) architecture can support researchers to establish the relationships between human social and physiological signals and emotions. In this paper, a wearable emotion sensing system is developed under narrow band internet of things (NB-IoT) wireless communication technology. The wearable sensing device integrates social linked sensors including voice, activity, and heart rate. Using this system, a dating experiment is set up to investigate multimodal factors of male&#x2019;s attractiveness perception. In particular, the multimodal data are fused in a graph structure, and this further leads to a graph convolutional neural networks model for emotion evaluation and a mental-sensing-graph intelligent interpreter. Different types of mental-sensing-graphs are fused during the training stage, and the model achieves a verification accuracy of 0.93. The intrinsic relationships among the multimodal data have been captured by the subgraphs which have star-shaped structures, and the center of the subgraphs are mostly audio node. The obtained results show that the attractiveness perception of the male participants in dating is more aligned to language communication. The results also reveal that when the male participants date highly attractive women during the experiments, a significant correlation is observed between the multimodal features and the attractiveness perception levels.

abstract={Historians of Britain and Ireland have long been interested in universities and students. They have acknowledged the importance of these institutions and individuals within the history of elites, the history of the state, intellectual history, the history of science, of social movements and of politics and political thought. Yet, for many years much of this research has centred around higher education institutions themselves rather than the student body that they cater for. Following the expansion of the higher education sector and the growth of the student movement in the 1960s the quantity and quality of literature on British and Irish students, rather than the institutions that they studied at, has grown substantially and has become a burgeoning historical field. This article surveys the development of this historiography and the key research perspectives on students in Britain and Ireland from 1800-1945, focusing on five thematic areas: student culture, student representation and politics, student life during war, students race and empire, and student women – to track the progress, development and connections between the different strands of this historiography over the past fifty years and to offer insights into potential avenues for further research. © 2022 The authors.},

abstract={The combined use of multiple omics allows to study complex interrelated biological processes in their entirety. We applied a combination of metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics to human bones to investigate their combined potential to estimate time elapsed since death (i.e., the postmortem interval [PMI]). This ‘ForensOMICS’ approach has the potential to improve accuracy and precision of PMI estimation of skeletonized human remains, thereby helping forensic investigators to establish the timeline of events surrounding death. Anterior midshaft tibial bone was collected from four female body donors before their placement at the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility owned by the Forensic Anthropological Center at Texas State (FACTS). Bone samples were again collected at selected PMIs (219-790-834-872days). Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to obtain untargeted metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic profiles from the pre-and post-placement bone samples. The three omics blocks were investigated independently by univariate and multivariate analyses, followed by Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent variable approaches for Omics studies (DIABLO), to identify the reduced number of markers describing postmortem changes and discriminating the individuals based on their PMI. The resulting model showed that pre-placement metabolome, lipidome and proteome profiles were clearly distinguishable from post-placement ones. Metabolites in the pre-placement samples suggested an extinction of the energetic metabolism and a switch towards another source of fuel-ling (e.g., structural proteins). We were able to identify certain biomolecules with an excellent potential for PMI estimation, predominantly the biomolecules from the metabolomics block. Our findings suggest that, by targeting a combination of compounds with different postmortem stability, in the future we could be able to estimate both short PMIs, by using metabolites and lipids, and longer PMIs, by using proteins. © Bonicelli et al.},

abstract={An untimely sudden or violent death is a risk for those serving in the armed forces and can result in unique challenges for surviving military family members. This research considered how bereavement affects a range of relationships for military bereaved families in the UK and how they impact the reconstruction of a new identity in civilian life. A two-phase exploratory sequential design, involving semi-structured interviews (n = 15) and a mixed methods survey (n = 264) of military family members, was conducted. Findings revealed changing relationships with friends and family over time, reconstruction of identity, long-term impact on children, and loneliness. © 2022 The Author(s).

funding_text 1={Participants for this study were recruited from across the UK using a convenience sampling strategy. Recruitment was peer-led by a member of the research team (MM) and was supported by the War Widows’ Association of Great Britain, the Royal Navy and Royal Marines (RNRM) Widows’ Association, the Army Widows’ Association, and the Royal Air Force (RAF) Widows’ Association. Participants who had lost a family member (spouse, partner, child, or parent) or whose death was attributable through service were eligible to participate in this study. Fifteen participants were recruited in phase one and 264 participants were recruited in phase two. From the 264 participants recruited in the second phase, 223 respondents provided textual data about their experiences of bereavement and provision of support and are included in this study. Participant characteristics are presented in . The number of years since time of death, for participants in both phase one and phase two, spanned from two to 93 years. Most participants from both phases of the research, who reported on the nature of the death, had experienced a traumatic or sudden loss (i.e., sudden or violent death whilst on active duty, accidental death whilst on training exercise, suicide, road traffic accident, or cardiac arrest).},

abstract={Introduction: Sexism, lack of sexual freedom, and negative attitudes towards minorities are related to risky and discriminatory sexual behaviors. To date, no cross-cultural comparisons have been made regarding these sexual behaviors and attitudes. The study also explores the sexuality competencies of young adults undertaking vocational courses in higher education before their transition to professional practice. Methods: The sample comprised 1235 university students (670 Spanish and 565 British) aged between 18 and 52 years (M = 22.06, SD = 4.38). During the years 2020 and 2021, respondents completed a survey structured in six standardized scales (HPSC, DSS, SOS, HATH, EANT, and TIBS). Results: Results report that British students show less gender adherence (DSS) while the Spanish ones show more positive attitudes towards trans individuals (EANT) and pleasure (SOS). These findings indicate that students in this research engage in more sexual risk behaviors (HPSC), display similar rigid gender adherences (DSS), and more positive erotophilic (SOS), homophilic (HATH), and trans-friendly attitudes (EANT and TIBS) than those in previous studies. There were, however, significant differences by gender, religion, and program of study. Conclusions: The research demonstrates the relevance of measuring cultural factors related to sexual behaviors and attitudes in youth and reflects a lack of attention to these issues in educational and healthcare settings. This is despite its broad impact on people’s health, as young people are more likely to display increased risky sexual behaviors. Policy Implications: These findings emphasize the importance of the development of updated strategies in sex education among young people. The added importance of doing so with students in higher education who are likely to enter professions where they will educate or influence others on these matters is identified. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Detecting gait phases with wearables unobtrusively and reliably in real-time is important for clinical gait rehabilitation and early diagnosis of neurological diseases. Due to hardware limitations of microcontrollers in wearable devices (e.g., memory and computation power), reliable real-time gait phase detection on the microcontrollers remains a challenge, especially for long-term real-world free-living gait. In this work, a novel algorithm based on a reduced support vector machine (RSVM) and a finite state machine (FSM) is developed to address this. The RSVM is developed by exploiting the cascaded K-means clustering to reduce the model size and computation time of a standard SVM by 88&#x0025; and a factor of 36, with only minor degradation in gait phase prediction accuracy of around 4&#x0025;. For each gait phase prediction from the RSVM, the FSM is designed to validate the prediction and correct misclassifications. The developed algorithm is implemented on a microcontroller of a wearable device and its real-time (on the fly) classification performance is evaluated by twenty healthy subjects walking along a predefined real-world route with uncontrolled free-living gait. It shows a promising real-time performance with an accuracy of 91.51&#x0025;, a sensitivity of 91.70&#x0025;, and a specificity of 95.77&#x0025;. The algorithm also demonstrates its robustness with varying walking conditions. IEEE},

abstract={The development of high performance, recyclable thermoset materials for applications in plastics, composites, coatings and adhesives requires a synthetic approach where recyclability is designed into the molecular structure of the material. This paper describes a single stage process for the creation of materials from simple, low-cost molecular building blocks, where the polymerisation of liquid epoxy resins and aliphatic amines in the presence of an n-butyl diboronic ester, delivers epoxy-amine-dioxazaborocane materials with tunable physical properties including glass transition temperature (Tg). Mechanical (thermal) recycling and reprocessing of the epoxy-amine-dioxazaborocane thermoset is demonstrated, with retention of Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength. Most notably, an efficient and low-cost process for the chemical recycling, disassembly and dissolution of the thermoset is demonstrated via two complementary processes using either pinacol (diol) or mono-functional phenylboronic ester. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Background: The aim was to identify independent preoperative factors associated with changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and whether these could be used as indicators for surgery. Methods: A retrospective study of 3127 TKA patients was undertaken that included 1194 (38.2%) male and 1933 (61.8%) female patients, with a mean age of 70.5 years (standard deviation 9.0). Patient demographics, body mass index and ASA grade, Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D) 3-level, which was used to assess HRQoL, were collected preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively. Results: When adjusting for confounding factors, obesity grade II (p = 0.002), ASA grade 3 (p = 0.002), and a better preoperative OKS (p < 0.001) or EQ-5D score (p < 0.001) were associated with a decreased improvement in the HRQoL at 2-years. A preoperative EQ-5D of < 0.8 (95.7% specific, AUC ≥ 67.0%) or an OKS of < 36 (97.1% specific, AUC ≥ 58.1%) was associated with a clinically significant improvement HRQoL. Patella resurfacing (n = 1454, 46.5%) was not independently associated with a clinical or statistically significant improvement in HRQoL. According to preoperative factors, no subgroup of patients benefited more from patella resurfacing according to improvement in their HRQoL. Conclusion: ASA grade 3, grade II obesity, a better preoperative EQ-5D or OKS were independently associated with a lesser improvement in HRQoL. The thresholds identified in the EQ-5D or OKS for a clinically significant improvement in HRQoL may be used as potential indicators for referral for TKA. Patella resurfacing was not independently associated with a clinically important improvement in HRQoL.

abstract={Future construction projects will need the implementation of industry 4.0 and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. The construction sector has, however, falling behind other industries in the application of these technologies and is currently facing considerable challenges. One of the industries that lag behind in the use of new innovative technological tools is the construction industry. This study reviews the research work in industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things as they relate to construction and examines key Ghana-based construction professionals and firms to ascertain their level of understanding of these emerging innovative technologies, including the challenges and benefits associated with their implementation. An extensive review of pertinent literature was done to help identify the important paradigms and variables which were cautiously tested. Adopting a quantitative research approach, the attained variables were used to design into a close-ended questionnaire. The sample frame was a survey of people from 154 construction experts and researchers with good standing by using the purposive sampling. Relative importance index (RII) analysis was used to analyzed the data. It was discovered from the findings that smart construction was the most popular industry 4.0 technology in the Ghanaian construction industry. The most important benefit of these technologies is that they will add sustainable policy requirements to tendering, with the most pressing technology being the lack of talent and skills in using industry 4.0 and IoT technologies. The scope of this research is based on the questionnaire survey, proving a sustainable pathway to the construction industry community, which creates its own significance by including key stakeholders and those affected by these technologies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose: With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, online assessment has become the dominant mode of examination in higher education institutions. However, there are contradictory findings on how students perceive online assessment and its impact on their academic performance. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of online assessment on students' academic performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a research model based on the task–technology fit theory and empirically validates the model using a survey from students in the UK. In addition, the study conducted four experiments based on paper-based and online assessments and analysed the data using paired sample t test and structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings show that the use of online assessment has a positive impact on students' academic performance. Similarly, the results from the experiment also indicate that students perform better using online assessments than paper-based assessments. Practical implications: The findings provide crucial evidence needed to shape policy towards institutionalising online assessment. In addition, the findings provide assurance to students, academics, administrators and policymakers that carefully designed online assessments can improve students' academic performance. Moreover, the study also provides important insights for curriculum redesign towards transitioning to online assessment in higher education institutions. Originality/value: This study advances research by offering a more nuanced understanding of online assessment on students' academic performance since the majority of previous studies have offered contradictory findings. In addition, the study moves beyond existing research by complementing assessment results with the views of students in evaluating the impact of online assessment on their academic performance. Second, the study develops and validates a research model that explains how the fits between technology and assessment tasks influence students' academic performance.

abstract={We present StyleBabel, a unique open access dataset of natural language captions and free-form tags describing the artistic style of over 135K digital artworks, collected via a novel participatory method from experts studying at specialist art and design schools. StyleBabel was collected via an iterative method, inspired by ‘Grounded Theory’: a qualitative approach that enables annotation while co-evolving a shared language for fine-grained artistic style attribute description. We demonstrate several downstream tasks for StyleBabel, adapting the recent ALADIN architecture for fine-grained style similarity, to train cross-modal embeddings for: 1) free-form tag generation; 2) natural language description of artistic style; 3) fine-grained text search of style. To do so, we extend ALADIN with recent advances in Visual Transformer (ViT) and cross-modal representation learning, achieving a state of the art accuracy in fine-grained style retrieval. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Objectives: Ground-based walking is a simple training modality which would suit pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) settings with limited access to specialist equipment. Patients with COPD are, however, unable to walk uninterruptedly at a relatively fast walking pace to optimise training benefits. We compared an intermittent (IntSW) to a continuous (CSW) shuttle walking protocol. Methods: In 14 COPD patients (mean ± SD. FEV1: 45 ± 21% predicted) we measured walking distance, cardiac output (CO), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and symptoms during (a) an IntSW protocol, consisting of 1-min walking alternating with 1-min rest, and (b) a CSW protocol, both sustained at 85% of predicted VO2 peak to the limit of tolerance (Tlim). Results: Median (IQR) distance was greater (p = 0.001) during the IntSW protocol (735 (375–1107) m) than the CSW protocol (190 (117–360) m). At iso-distance (distance at Tlim during CSW) the IntSW compared to the CSW protocol was associated with lower CO (8.6 ± 2.6 vs 10.3 ± 3.7 L/min; p = 0.013), greater SpO2 (92 ± 6% versus 90 ± 7%; p = 0.002), and lower symptoms of dyspnoea (2.8 ± 1.3 vs 4.9 ± 1.4; p = 0.001) and leg discomfort (2.3 ± 1.7 vs 4.2 ± 2.2; p = 0.001). At Tlim symptoms of dyspnoea and leg discomfort did not differ between the IntSW (4.4 ± 1.9 and 3.6 ± 2.1, respectively) and the CSW protocol. Conclusions: The IntSW protocol may provide important clinical benefits during exercise training in the PR settings because it allows greater work outputs compared to the CSW. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Magnetism dominates the structure and dynamics of the solar corona. To understand the true nature of the solar corona and the long-standing coronal heating problem requires measuring the vector magnetic field of the corona at a sufficiently high resolution (spatially and temporally) across a large Field-of-View (FOV). Despite the importance of the magnetic field in the physics of the corona and despite the tremendous progress made recently in the remote sensing of solar magnetic fields, reliable measurements of the coronal magnetic field strength and orientation do not exist. This is largely due to the weakness of coronal magnetic fields, previously estimated to be on the order of 1-10 G, and the difficulty associated with observing the extremely faint solar corona emission. With the Solar cUbesats for Linked Imaging Spectro-polarimetry (SULIS) mission, we plan to finally observe, in detail and over the long-term, uninterrupted measurements of the coronal magnetic vector field using a new and very affordable instrument design concept. This will be profoundly important in the study of local atmospheric coronal heating processes, as well as in measuring the nature of magnetic clouds, in particular, within geoeffective Earth-bound Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) for more accurate forecasting of severe space weather activity. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Managing and analysing large qualitative datasets pose a particular challenge for researchers seeking a consistent and rigorous approach to qualitative data analysis. This paper describes and demonstrates the development and adoption of a matrix tool to guide the qualitative data analysis of a large sample (N = 122) of interview data.

abstract={Objective: To determine the impact of supplemental bovine lactoferrin on the gut microbiome and metabolome of preterm infants. Design: Cohort study nested within a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Infants across different trial arms were matched on several clinical variables. Bacteria and metabolite compositions of longitudinal stool and urine samples were analysed to investigate the impact of lactoferrin supplementation. Setting: Thirteen UK hospitals participating in a RCT of lactoferrin. Patients: 479 infants born <32 weeks' gestation between June 2016 and September 2017. Results: 10 990 stool and 22 341 urine samples were collected. Analyses of gut microbiome (1304 stools, 201 infants), metabolites (171 stools, 83 infants; 225 urines, 90 infants) and volatile organic compounds (314 stools, 117 infants) were performed. Gut microbiome Shannon diversity at 34 weeks corrected age was not significantly different between infants in the lactoferrin (mean=1.24) or placebo (mean=1.06) groups (p=0.11). Lactoferrin receipt explained less than 1% variance in microbiome compositions between groups. Metabolomic analysis identified six discriminative features between trial groups. Hospital site (16%) and postnatal age (6%) explained the greatest variation in microbiome composition. Conclusions: This multiomic study identified minimal impacts of lactoferrin but much larger impacts of hospital site and postnatal age. This may be due to the specific lactoferrin product used, but more likely supports the findings of the RCT in which this study was nested, which showed no impact of lactoferrin on reducing rates of sepsis. Multisite mechanistic studies nested within RCTs are feasible and help inform trial interpretation and future trial design. © 2022 Author(s). Published by BMJ.},

abstract={This paper advances our understanding of how organisations engage in the process of Bourdieusian capital conversion during crises of socio-political legitimacy. We do so by analysing the arts sponsorship strategies of Barclays between 1972 and 1987. During this period, Barclays faced numerous challenges to its organisational legitimacy as a result of its continued dealings in apartheid South Africa and its ability to generate extraordinary profits despite general economic malaise in Britain. As a response, Barclays increased its sponsorship of the arts, exchanging its substantial economic capital for the symbolic capital associated with high-status arts institutions. We identify the forces that facilitated and inhibited these capital exchanges and how they affected Barclays’ sponsorship strategies. This paper will be of interest to Bourdieusian scholars interested in capital exchange, to business historians interested in banking in Britain during the 1970s and 1980s, and researchers interested in the evolution of corporate sponsorship and philanthropy. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Situated within the field of platform governance studies, this paper shares findings from an ‘autoethnography of automated powerlessness’, drawing from the researcher’s disempowering experience of being a heavily moderated social media user. Using theoretical frameworks blending affordances and World Risk Society theories, this paper contextualises my experiences of moderation of my pole dance instructor, activist and blogger account @bloggeronpole from February to October 2021 within social media’s broader de-platforming of nudity and sexuality, finding fallacies within platforms’ own affordances, which lack mechanisms to aid or rehabilitate de-platformed accounts. With little to no information from platforms about the details of their moderation, qualitative, ethnographic and autoethnographic explorations of their governance are all users currently have to fight and understand their puritan, patriarchal censorship of nudity and sexuality, which are often conflated with risk. This study concludes with recommendations for different options for better, more equal and community focused moderation. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Introduction: Positive risk-taking in occupational therapy intermediate care is a requirement, yet little is known about how positive risk-taking barriers influence discharge decisions at different experience levels. Method: A factorial survey was used to investigate positive risk-taking barriers (Limited Capacity, Risk Averse Family, Blame Culture and No Support). Participants self-categorised their experience level into Novice or Semi-expert or Expert before analysing four vignettes relating to recommending a home discharge for an older adult. Data were analysed using Multiple Regression and One-Way Analysis of Variance. Results: Seventy-four participants responded to two hundred eighty-one vignettes. The barriers that reduced the likelihood to recommend a home discharge for an older adult were ‘No Support’, Novices (β = −0.315, p = 0.002), Semi-experts (β = −0.313, p = 0.001) Experts (β = −0.254, p = 0.009); ‘Limited Capacity’, Novices (β = −0.305, p < 0.003), Semi-experts (β = −0.254, p = 0.006) Experts (β = −0.376, p = 0.001) and ‘Blame Culture’ Semi-experts (β = −0.240, p = 0.010). Novices were found to be less likely to recommend a home discharge by comparison. Conclusion: The ‘Limited Capacity’, ‘No Support’ and ‘Blame Culture’ barriers had the strongest effect and Novices were less likely to recommend a home discharge overall. These findings could inform future research and pre-registration Occupational Therapy education. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={This case focuses on the entrepreneurial use of multi-stakeholder value co-creation to emerge stronger from challenging trading conditions. In particular, it examines Pennine Pubs, a small-/medium-sized enterprise (SME) operating several rural public houses, which are licensed to sell food and alcoholic drinks to guests. Based in Northern England, it has adapted commercial strategies to mitigate government-enforced Covid-19 lockdowns. Pennine Pubs’ Managing Director is currently considering how to build upon the multi-stakeholder value co-creation strategy which emerged quickly immediately before and during the first lockdown period, when customers were prohibited from visiting pubs. He expects the outcome to be a more refined and sustainable commercial strategy which retains the most significant benefits of his lockdown-period innovations. The case considers how co-creation is applied as a reaction to unforeseen business challenges, and how it can underpin proactive strategies to capitalise upon favourable trading conditions. The concept is explored in the context of rapidly evolving, unpredictable and highly problematic constraints upon retail trade, and the ‘new normal’ of customers returning to retail premises, albeit with expectations modified by recent experiences. Finally, the case considers the impact of SMEs collaborating with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders to co-create mutual, commercially sustainable value. © The Author(s) 2022.},
